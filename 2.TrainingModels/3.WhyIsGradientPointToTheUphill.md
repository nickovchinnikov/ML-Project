Each component of the gradient tells you how fast your function is changing with respect to the standard basis.  It's not too far-fetched then to wonder, how fast the function might be changing with respect to some arbitrary direction?  Letting $\vec v$ denote a unit vector, we can project along this direction in the natural way, namely via the dot product $\text{grad}( f(a))\cdot \vec v$.  This is a fairly common definition of the directional derivative.

We can then ask in what direction is this quantity maximal?  You'll recall that $$\text{grad}( f(a))\cdot \vec v = |\text{grad}( f(a))|| \vec v|\text{cos}(\theta)$$

Since $\vec v$ is unit, we have $|\text{grad}( f)|\text{cos}(\theta)$, which is maximal when $\cos(\theta)=1$, in particular when $\vec v$ points in the same direction as $\text{grad}(f(a))$.


The question you're asking can be rephrased as "In which direction is the directional derivative $\nabla_{\hat{u}}f$ a maximum?".

Assuming differentiability, $\nabla_{\hat{u}}f$ can be written as:

$$\nabla_{\hat{u}}f = \nabla f(\textbf{x}) \cdot \hat{u} =|\nabla f(\textbf{x})||\hat{u}|\cos \theta = |\nabla f(\textbf{x})|\cos \theta$$

which is a maximum when $\theta =0$: when $\nabla f(\textbf{x})$ and $\hat{u}$ are parallel.


Just want to further clarify why the gradient provides the steepest ascent (instead of descent) here. Any differentiable $f$ can be approximated by the linear tangent plane, i.e., $$f(\mathbf{x} + h \mathbf{v}) = f(\mathbf{x}) + h \, \nabla f(\mathbf{x})^T \mathbf{v} $$ as $h \rightarrow 0$ for any unit-length direction $\mathbf{v}$ with $\parallel \mathbf{v} \parallel =1.$ As $h \downarrow 0$,  consider the amount of change
$$ 
 f(\mathbf{x} + h \mathbf{v}) - f(\mathbf{x}) = h \, \left\{  \, \nabla f(\mathbf{x})^T \mathbf{v} \right\} 
~~\in~~  \left[ - h \, \parallel \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \parallel, ~ h \, \parallel \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \parallel \right]
$$
by Cauchy-Swcharz inequality, which reaches its maximum (increase) $(h \, \parallel \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \parallel)$ when $\mathbf{v} =  \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) / \parallel \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \parallel$  and its minimum (i.e., maximum decrease) $ (-h \, \parallel \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \parallel) $ if $ \mathbf{v}= - \nabla f(\mathbf{x})/\parallel \nabla f(\mathbf{x}) \parallel$  (the negative gradient  direction).
